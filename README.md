# Smart Planner
 An intelligent and responsive tasks management web application built with Flask and SQLite.  
 note: This project is for Horizons.

--------------
## Why I built it:

before knowing Horizons, I created a basic terminal application that manage tasks and store all the data in csv files, but after knowing Hackclub, I had the motivation to push my project to the edge and create my own completed website


--------------
## Project evolution
v1 : Basic terminal application using interactive key prompts like (yes,no).  
v2 : command lines interface like git.   
v3 : Full web interface built with Flask, moving from CSV to SQLAlchemy & SQLite  
[You can see the project versions in the project tags](https://github.com/82936473/Horizons-AI/tags)

## How it works
In the first time trying the application, you should sign up by dropping your email, creating a password, and choose a name.  
You'll receive a greeting email and you'll have a personal account protected by password hashing.
After logging in, you can scroll between pages and manage your tasks, projects, and view statistics easily, plus using ai to to make that more easier and fast.  
Get a weekly email summary for your last actions.
